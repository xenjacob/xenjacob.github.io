The Mighty Meaty MIDI Grinder

turns any MIDI file into a challenge of human performance:
can you get the song to sound like it's supposed to sound?
Input any MIDI file, or have the app crawl the web for one at random.
Choose tracks and assign instruments (unimplemented; right now everything is piano)
Then, grind away by mashing keyboard keys or clicking.
Each event triggers the next note or chord, kind of like advancing a musical slideshow.
With the challenge of hitting the *right* keys removed, can you deliver a *musical* performance?
